#  ðŸ“Š Data Job Market Report

A dashboard that provides insights on the current data job market by analyzing hundreds of LinkedIn job ads to find the required skills and tools for Data Scientist and Data Analyst roles.

## App
[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://datajobmarket.streamlit.app/)

## Motivation
This dashboard was created mainly to help up-and-coming Data Analysts and Data Scientists get a better understanding of the necessary skills needed to break into the job market.

My goal is to maintain this dashboard for as long as possible by continuing to acquire new data (job ads) to analyze and ensure the dashboard reflects the current job market.

All Python libraries used in the creation of this dashboard app can be found in the file `requirements.txt`
