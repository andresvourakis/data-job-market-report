## Motivation
This dashboard was created mainly to help up-and-coming Data Analysts and Data Scientists get a better understanding of the skills needed to break into the job market.

My goal is to maintain this dashboard for as long as possible by continuing to acquire new data (job ads) to analyze and ensure the dashboard always reflects the current job market.

## Prerequisite libraries
All Python libraries used in the creation of this dashboard app can be found in the file `requirements.txt`

## Data source
All data has been scraped from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/" target="_blank">LinkedIn Jobs</a>
